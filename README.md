# AlienInvasion
A two-dimensional game of Alien Invasion, featuring my dog Max as the defender of the galaxy! When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player's goal is to shoot and destroy the aliens. If the player shoots all of the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
